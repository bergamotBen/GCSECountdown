# GCSECountdown

In this project, I wanted to practise using:

- parallax scroll
- BEM naming conventions for CSS tags
- Vanilla JS for webpages

## Parallax Scroll

Implementing the parallax scroll was much more difficult than I'd anticipated. Whilst I understand the principles behind creating the effect, I underestimated the amount of pixel-by-pixel positioning I'd have to do. This means that whereas I am confident it works on most browsers in fullscreen, mobile devices will probably not look as good. They should however, display all of the elements without obscuring any others.

## BEM naming

When it became apparent quite how many CSS tags I was going to be using, I decided that I should use a standardised naming convention. I am now more familiar with BEM and have tried to implement it within this project. This means that the CSS should be human-readable.

## Vanilla JS

Writing the JS was pretty straightforward. I am now more able to find and manipulate properties of DOM objects. The benefit of using a simple index, styles and script static file structure for this project is that I can host it as an always-on project on Glitch enabling me to access it and help my students see their exams getting ever closer.
